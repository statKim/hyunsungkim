I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/), under the supervision of Prof. [Junyong Park](https://hdmtlab.github.io/people/junyong_park/index.html).
I am also a member of [High Dimensional Multiple Testing Lab](https://hdmtlab.github.io/).
Prior to that, I received my M.A. in Statistics and B.A. in Applied Statistics at [Chung-Ang University](https://stat.cau.ac.kr/) under the supervision of Prof. [Yaeji Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/yaejilim).
<!--I was also a member of the [Multivariate Statistics Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/yaejilim).-->

My research interests include Functional Data Analysis, High-Dimensional Data Analysis, and Multiple Testing.
<!--Currently, my main research lies in classification and FDR control for functional data.-->
